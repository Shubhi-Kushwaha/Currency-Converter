Currency Converter Project: A Practical Web Application 

I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on: a Currency Converter application! 

Overview:
This web application allows users to convert currencies in real-time, providing up-to-date exchange rates and visual feedback through flags. It combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly tool for managing currency conversions.

Key Features:
  * Dynamic Currency Dropdowns
  * Users can select currencies from dropdown menus.
  * Automatic flag updates based on selected currencies for better visual representation.
    
Real-Time Exchange Rates:
  * Fetches live exchange rates from an API.
  * Converts the entered amount to the selected target currency.
  * User-Friendly Interface:
  * Clean and intuitive design.
  * Displays the conversion result in an easy-to-read format.
Technical Details:
  * HTML & CSS: Used for creating and styling the layout.
  * JavaScript:
  * API Integration: Retrieves currency data from a live API.
  * DOM Manipulation: Updates dropdown options and flag images dynamically.
  * Event Handling: Listens for user interactions to trigger updates.
API Used:
  * Fawaz Ahmed's Currency API: Provides up-to-date currency exchange rates.
Demo:

Code Snippet:
Here’s a peek at how the currency conversion logic is implemented:


JavaScriptcode:
const BASE_URL = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies";

const updateExchangeRate = async() => {
    let amount = document.querySelector(".amount input");
    let amtVal = amount.value || 1;
    const URL = `${BASE_URL}/${fromCurr.value.toLowerCase()}.min.json`;
    let response = await fetch(URL);
    let data = await response.json();
    let rate = data[fromCurr.value.toLowerCase()][toCurr.value.toLowerCase()];
    let finalAmount = amtVal * rate;
    msg.innerText = `${amtVal} ${fromCurr.value} = ${finalAmount} ${toCurr.value}`;
}
Challenges Faced:
  * Ensuring the currency data updates in real-time with accurate rates.
  * Handling user input and dynamically updating the UI based on selections.
Future Improvements:
  * Adding error handling for API requests.
  * Enhancing the design for mobile responsiveness.
  * Including historical data for currency trends.
Feel free to try it out and let me know your feedback.
